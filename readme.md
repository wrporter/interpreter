# Interpreter

This project is a learning experience on what it takes to build an interpreter. I started with the [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/) book and plan to extend onto the language.

## Usage

### Shell

Run the interpreter in an interactive shell.

```shell
go run main.go
```

### Execute File

Execute a file written in the supported language.

```shell
go run main.go program.monkey
```
